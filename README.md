# CS400 (January 2023 - May 2023)
Code written for a senior level course in the AHS Computer Science Pre-Professional Program, in which we built a cluster of 5 raspberry pi computers (one main node, with 4 worker nodes), using multiprocessing and distributed computing to process large quantities of data efficiently.

## Unit 1: Cluster Build & Observability
01. assembled cluster, connected using SSH, enabled wifi, nfs, etc
02. allowed for data visualization through prometheus, node exporter, and grafana

## Unit 2: Multiprocessing & Software Patterns
## Unit 3: Distributed Computing
## Final Project

# CS400-Big-Data-Architecture
Code written for a senior level course in the AHS Computer Science Pre-Professional Program, in which we built a cluster of 5 raspberry pi computers (one main node, with 4 worker nodes), using multiprocessing and distributed computing to process large quantities of data efficiently.
